Maintaining a successful open source project is challenging. Most contributors are volunteers (thank you!), and even for those who receive remuneration there are often challenges. Someone might be paid a fixed amount to contribute a specific feature, or might be given permission to spend some, usually small, fraction of their time on the project. As a very immediate example, I'm a volunteer writing this post for QuTiP at 21:30 at night while my wife puts my daughter to sleep.

QuTiP isn't just any project though. It's a *big* [^1], *mature* [^2], *open quantum systems* [^3] project, and each of these come with their own additional challenges (and rewards, of course).

That's why when [Andy Oram](http://praxagora.com/) offered to interview us about running QuTiP, we leapt at the opportunity.

Andy also interviewed two other projects, [OQTOPUS](https://oqtopus-team.github.io/) and [classiq](https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library), who have their own unique experiences and stories to share.

You can find the two articles Andy wrote at the [Linux Professional Institute](https://www.lpi.org/) blog:

or via the links at the top of this post.

Thank you Andy for taking the time to interview us and for corralling our sometimes rambling responses!

[^1]: QuTiP is a big. We actively release at least 8 separate packages, across two languages (Python & Julia), and maintain at least 14 separate repositories, providing not only the software itself but also tutorials, documentation, benchmarks, and this webiste.

[^2]: QuTiP is mature. The repository is 14 years old. We're on version 5 and planning version 6. We're still going strong. It's used and worked on by people all over the world everyday.

[^3]: Open Quantum Systems are complex. Contributing doesn't necessarily require vast experience (we regularly have excellent contributions from even undergraduate students), but it does require *headspace*. Getting really stuck into a topic might require reading a research paper or a textbook.
