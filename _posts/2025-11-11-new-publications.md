The QuTiP development community is pleased to share that both the Quantum Toolbox in Python 5 ([QuTiP 5](https://qutip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) and the Quantum Toolbox in Julia ([QuantumToolbox.jl](https://qutip.org/QuantumToolbox.jl)) have recently published major research papers highlighting their latest advances in open quantum system simulation and quantum information science.

These publications represent a milestone in the continued development of open-source platforms for quantum dynamics and control. They showcase unified approaches to efficient quantum simulation, GPU acceleration, and integration with modern scientific computing ecosystems.

We thank the global QuTiP and QuantumToolbox.jl communities for their ongoing contributions and invite researchers to explore these works to see the future of quantum simulation frameworks.

If you use any of our packages in your research, we would be grateful if you cite the corresponding paper.
