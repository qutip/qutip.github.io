- [Check out the new design!](https://qutip.org)

Hello everybody,

As some of you may have already seen, the QuTiP website has acquired a new look. With the new design, mobile browsing got more enjoyable and the accessibility of important material such as documentation and tutorials was greatly improved. We also put an emphasis on the ever growing QuTiP family that includes Quantum Toolbox in Julia and all the other QuTiP packages.

We aim to further improve the online experience step by step over the next months, so please check it out and let us know what you think!

A big thank you to the whole admin team and especially Simon Cross, Alex Pitchford, Neill Lambert and Yi-Te Huang for guiding this project and providing lots of valuable input.

Among other things, we added dedicated pages for [researchers](https://qutip.org/research) and [educators](https://qutip.org/education) so they can learn how to use QuTiP in their field.
We have also redesigned the [tutorials](https://qutip.org/tutorials) and aim to further improve it's accessibility over the next few months.
