As of version 2.2, QuTiP includes an optional Fortran-based Monte Carlo solver that has some performance benefit over the Python-based solver when simulating small systems. In order to install this package you must have a Fortran compiler (for example gfortran) and BLAS development libraries.  At present, these packages are tested only on the Linux and OS X platforms.


.. _install-platform-independent:

Platform-independent installation
=================================

Often the easiest way is to install QuTiP is to use the Python package manager `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install qutip

Or, optionally, to also include the Fortran-based Monte Carlo solver:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install qutip --install-option=--with-f90mc

More detailed platform-dependent installation alternatives are given below.

.. _install-get-it:

Get the source code
===================

Official releases of QuTiP are available from the download section on the project's web pages

    http://www.qutip.org/download.html

and the latest source code is available in our Github repository

    http://github.com/qutip

In general we recommend users to use the latest stable release of QuTiP, but if you are interested in helping us out with development or wish to submit bug fixes, then use the latest development version from the Github repository.

.. _install-it:

Installing from source
======================

Installing QuTiP from source requires that all the dependencies are satisfied. The installation of these dependencies is different on each platform, and detailed instructions for Linux (Ubuntu), Mac OS X and Windows are given below.

Regardless of platform, to install QuTiP from the source code run::

    sudo python setup.py install

To also include the optional Fortran Monte Carlo solver, run::

    sudo python setup.py install --with-f90mc

On Windows, omit ``sudo`` from the commands given above.

.. _install-linux:

Installation on Ubuntu Linux
============================

Using QuTiP's PPA
-------------------

The easiest way to install QuTiP in Ubuntu (14.04 and later) is to use the QuTiP PPA

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jrjohansson/qutip-releases
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-qutip

A Python 3 version is also available, and can be installed using:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python3-qutip

With this method the most important dependencies are installed automatically, and when a new version of QuTiP is released it can be upgraded through the standard package management system. In addition to the required dependencies, it is also strongly recommended that you install the ``texlive-latex-extra`` package::

    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

Manual installation of dependencies
-----------------------------------

First install the required dependencies using:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-dev cython python-setuptools python-nose
    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib

Then install QuTiP from source following the instructions given above.

Alternatively (or additionally), to install a Python 3 environment, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev cython3 python3-setuptools python3-nose
    sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib

and then do the installation from source using ``python3`` instead of ``python``.

Optional, but recommended, dependencies can be installed using:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra # recommended for plotting
    sudo apt-get install mayavi2             # optional, for Bloch3d only
    sudo apt-get install libblas-dev         # optional, for Fortran Monte Carlo solver
    sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev       # optional, for Fortran Monte Carlo solver
    sudo apt-get install gfortran            # optional, for Fortran Monte Carlo solver

.. _install-mac:

Installation on Mac OS X (10.8+)
=================================

Setup Using Homebrew
---------------------

The latest version of QuTiP can be quickly installed on OS X using `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ and the automated installation shell scripts

    `Python 2.7 installation script <https://raw.github.com/qutip/qutip/master/mac/install_qutip_py2.sh>`_

    `Python 3.4 installation script <https://raw.github.com/qutip/qutip/master/mac/install_qutip_py3.sh>`_

Having downloaded the script corresponding to the version of Python you want to use, the installation script can be run from the terminal using (replacing X with 2 or 3)

.. code-block:: bash

    sh install_qutip_pyX.sh

The script will then install Homebrew and the required QuTiP dependencies before installing QuTiP itself and running the built in test suite.  Any errors in the homebrew configuration will be displayed at the end.  Using Python 2.7 or 3.4, the python commend-line and IPython interpreter can be run by calling ``python`` and ``ipython`` or ``python3`` and ``ipython3``, respectively.


If you have installed other packages in the ``/usr/local/`` directory, or have changed the permissions of any of its sub-directories, then this script may fail to install all the necessary tools automatically.


Setup Using Macports
---------------------

If you have not done so already, install the Apple Xcode developer tools from the Apple App Store.  After installation, open Xcode and go to: Preferences -> Downloads, and install the 'Command Line Tools'.

On the Mac OS, you can install the required libraries via `MacPorts <http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts>`_.  After installation, the necessary "ports" for QuTiP may be installed via (Replace '34' with '27' if you want Python 2.7)

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port install py34-scipy
    sudo port install py34-matplotlib +latex
    sudo port install py34-cython
    sudo port install py34-ipython +notebook+parallel
    sudo port install py34-pip

Now, we want to tell OS X which Python and iPython we are going to use

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port select python python34
    sudo port select ipython ipython34
    sudo port select pip pip34

We now want to set the macports compiler to the vanilla GCC version.  From the command line type

.. code-block:: bash

    port select gcc

which will bring up a list of installed compilers, such as

.. code-block:: bash

	Available versions for gcc:
		mp-gcc48
		none (active)

We want to set the the compiler to the gcc4x compiler, where x is the highest number available, in this case ``mp-gcc48`` (the "mp-" does not matter).  To do this type

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port select gcc mp-gcc48

Running port select again should give

.. code-block:: bash

	 Available versions for gcc:
	 	mp-gcc48 (active)
	 	none

To install QuTiP, run

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip install qutip --install-option=--with-f90mc


.. warning::
    
    Having both macports and homebrew installations on the same machine is not recommended, and can lead to QuTiP installation problems.



Setup via SciPy Superpack
-------------------------

A third option is to install the required Python packages using the `SciPy Superpack <http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/>`_.  Further information on installing the superpack can be found on the `SciPy Downloads page <http://www.scipy.org/Download>`_. 


Anaconda CE Distribution
------------------------

Finally, one can also use the `Anaconda CE <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda>`_ package to install all of QuTiP. 

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/jrjohansson qutip

.. _install-win:

Installation on Windows
=======================

QuTiP is primarily developed for Unix-based platforms such as Linux an Mac OS X, but it can also be used on Windows. We have limited experience and ability to help troubleshoot problems on Windows, but the following installation steps have been reported to work:

1. Install the `Python(X,Y) <http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_ distribution (tested with version 2.7.3.1). Other Python distributions, such as `Enthought Python Distribution <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_ or `Anaconda CE <http://continuum.io/downloads.html>`_ have also been reported to work.

2. When installing Python(x,y), explicitly select to include the Cython package in the installation. This package is not selected by default.

3. Add the following content to the file `C:/Python27/Lib/distutils/distutils.cfg` (or create the file if it does not already exists)::

    [build]
    compiler = mingw32

    [build_ext]
    compiler = mingw32

The directory where the distutils.cfg file should be placed might be different if you have installed the Python environment in a different location than in the example above.

4. Obtain the QuTiP source code and installed it following the instructions given above.

.. note::

    In some cases, to get the dynamic compilation of Cython code to work, it
    might be necessary to edit the PATH variable and make sure that
    `C:\\MinGW32-xy\\bin` appears either *first* in the PATH list, or possibly
    *right after* `C:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\\PyQt4`. This is to make sure
    that the right version of the MinGW compiler is used if more than one
    is installed (not uncommon under Windows, since many packages are
    distributed and installed with their own version of all dependencies).


.. _install-optional:

Optional Installation Options
=============================

.. _install-umfpack:

UMFPACK Linear Solver
---------------------

As of SciPy 0.14+, the `umfpack <http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/>`_ linear solver routines for solving large-scale sparse linear systems have been replaced due to licensing restrictions.  The default method for all sparse linear problems is now the `SuperLU <http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/>`_ library.  However, scipy still includes the ability to call the umfpack library via the scikits.umfpack module.  In our experience, the umfpack solver is 2-5x faster than the SuperLU routines, which is a very noticeable performance increase when used for solving steady state solutions.  We have an updated scikits.umfpack module available at `http://github.com/nonhermitian/umfpack <https://github.com/nonhermitian/umfpack>`_ that can be installed to have SciPy find and use the umfpack library.


.. _install-blas:

Optimized BLAS Libraries
------------------------

QuTiP is designed to take advantage of some of the optimized BLAS libraries that are available for NumPy.  At present, this includes the `OPENBLAS <http://www.openblas.net/>`_ and `MKL <http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl>`_ libraries.  If NumPy is built against these libraries, then QuTiP will take advantage of the performance gained by using these optimized tools.  As these libraries are multi-threaded, you can change the number of threads used in these packages by adding: 

>>> import os
>>> os.environ['OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'
>>> os.environ['MKL_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'

**at the top of your Python script files**, or iPython notebooks, and then loading the QuTiP framework. If these commands are not present, then QuTiP automatically sets the number of threads to one.

.. _install-verify:

Verifying the Installation
==========================

QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library. After installing QuTiP, leave the installation directory, run Python (or iPython), and call:

>>> import qutip.testing as qt
>>> qt.run()

If successful, these tests indicate that all of the QuTiP functions are working properly.  If any errors occur, please check that you have installed all of the required modules.  See the next section on how to check the installed versions of the QuTiP dependencies. If these tests still fail, then head on over to the `QuTiP Discussion Board <http://groups.google.com/group/qutip>`_ and post a message detailing your particular issue.

.. _install-about:

Checking Version Information using the About Function
=====================================================

QuTiP includes an "about" function for viewing information about QuTiP and the important dependencies installed on your system.  To view this information:

.. ipython::

   In [1]: from qutip import *

   In [2]: about()
