# Citing QuTiP

QuTiP is developed by [several physicists](devs.html) in their spare time.
As with anyone in academics,
their life and death is determined entirely by citations and paper count.
Therefore, if you find QuTiP useful, please consider citing this project as:

 * N. Lambert, E. Giguère, P. Menczel, B. Li, P. Hopf, G. Suárez, M. Gali, J. Lishman, R. Gadhvi, R. Agarwal, A. Galicia, N. Shammah, P. Nation, J. R. Johansson, S. Ahmed, S. Cross, A. Pitchford, F. Nori: "QuTiP 5: The Quantum Toolbox in Python", (2024) [DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2412.04705](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04705)

 * J. R. Johansson, P. D. Nation, and F. Nori: "QuTiP 2: A Python framework for the dynamics of open quantum systems.", Comp. Phys. Comm. **184**, 1234 (2013), [DOI: 10.1016/j.cpc.2012.11.019](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2012.11.019).

 * J. R. Johansson, P. D. Nation, and F. Nori: "QuTiP: An open-source Python framework for the dynamics of open quantum systems.", Comp. Phys. Comm. **183**, 1760–1772 (2012), [DOI: 10.1016/j.cpc.2012.02.021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2012.02.021).

This will also help us secure future funding supporting the development of this software.

PDF versions of these papers may be found on the ArXiv preprint server
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0573) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6518).

If you do use QuTiP in a publication, please take a few minutes and let us know
by posting on the [QuTiP message board](https://groups.google.com/group/qutip).

We would love to hear how QuTiP is being used as a research tool.
